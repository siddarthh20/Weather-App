# Weather-App

This project is a visually engaging weather application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display real-time weather data for any city entered by the user. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features an interactive flip card design that reveals weather details upon hovering. Users can search for a city to view current temperature, humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures, and a relevant weather icon. The CSS enhances user experience with smooth animations and responsive styling, while a scenic background adds to its appeal.
